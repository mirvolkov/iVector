There is amazing tiny but powerful robot Anki vector https://www.digitaldreamlabs.com/collections/vector-products. It is provided with GRPC API and SDK https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/index.html. However there is no Swift port of it. Existing python solution is not applicable for iOS/iPadOS platform s and it was starting point for developing this pet project. 
Next, I wanted to implement contol simular to ancient lunar rover https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Trak toy. Allow to type in simple sequences of commands and execute them one by one, name them as subroutines, store and sync with cloud storage. 
And finally, powered with outstanding apple hardware, it bring new features like vision (ObjectDetection with MobileNet model), speech recognition and decision making backed with seq-to-seq neural network model
