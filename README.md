### iVector pet project

    There is amazing tiny but powerful robot Anki vector https://www.digitaldreamlabs.com/collections/vector-products. It is provided with GRPC API and SDK https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/index.html. However there is no Swift port of it. Existing python solution is not applicable for iOS/iPadOS platform s and it was starting point for developing this pet project. <br />
    Next, I wanted to implement contol simular to ancient lunar rover https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Trak toy. Allow to type in simple sequences of commands and execute them one by one, name them as subroutines, store and sync with cloud storage. <br />
    And finally, powered with outstanding apple hardware, it bring new features like vision (ObjectDetection with MobileNet model), speech recognition and decision making backed with seq-to-seq neural network model <br />

**Architectural notes**
- iOS 16+, macOS 11+, iPadOS 16+
- MVVM based on pure SwiftUI
- Modular architecture
- Combine archutecture on top level
- Async/await concurrency model 
- Test coverage

**Tech stack**
- GRPC to communicate with Anki Vector 
- Object detection (MobileNetV2 background)
- On-edge speech recognition (Apple SpeechKit)
